## Welcome to my blog source code

Here are the various way you can contribute to it:

### Donate

Content on the internet is usually free, but you must *think free as in free speech, not free beer.*. There is a *Sponsor* button on this page if your willing to pay me for the work I made in the past or I'll do in the future. I stopped drinking alcohol on a regular basis but I'm a coffee lover and know [some very good alcohol free beer](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/shop/beer?dietary_and_lifestyle=1717). I also dream to build this kind of ship one day:

### Make a pull request

You can evenly use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MartinDelille/martindelille.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for the file that you want to fix.

You can also clone the repository and fix it locally then push it on a fork and submit the pull request.

Here are the step for a local development environment:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

I wrote a [Makefile](Makefile) with additional options for conveniancy.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
