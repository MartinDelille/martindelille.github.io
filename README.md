## Welcome to my blog source code

Here are the various way you can contribute to it:

### Make a pull request

You can evenly use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MartinDelille/martindelille.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for the file that you want to fix.

You can also clone the repository and fix it locally then push it on a fork and submit the pull request.

Here are the step for a local development environment:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

I wrote a [Makefile](Makefile) with additional options for conveniancy.
